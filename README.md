# Horiseon-Challenge-1
Bootcamp "HTML/CSS" Challenge #1

Hello, my name is Bryan Gomez.
A Coding BootCamp Student from Mexico.

This project was made to fix the existing HTML code from the WebPage of Horiseon (a Social Solution Services page);
we achive this by changing the "non-semantic" HTML elements, to "Semantic" logical elements,
we also added "alt" attributes to the existing images, to implement better practices and to make the WebPage por accessible.
 
A concise and descriptive "Title" was also added to the code, and the structure of the HTML elements was also reviewed so that it
follows a logical structure (independent of the styling and positioning),together with the sequential order of the "heading" attributes.


To Run the project, you just need to open the given URL or open the HTML file.
